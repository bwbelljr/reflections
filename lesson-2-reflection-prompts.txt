What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I create a repository, git adds a directory (/.git) which stores metadata about the repo.
I want to do this to tell git what to track and to begin the process of committing.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area allows me to specify which files will be part of a commit. Working directory
is only where I have files that I might commit. Working directory allows me to have
a folder that has files I MIGHT commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
