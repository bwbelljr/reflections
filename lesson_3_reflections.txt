When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would like to use a remote repository when I use multiple computers and/or work with others to contribute to a git repository. A remote repository makes it possible to keep the commit history in sync across machines and collaborators.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I think this allows me to sync files on my local machine when I am ready. For example, I might make changes to specific files. Automatically pulling changes to my machine might introduce unexpected merging issues.
